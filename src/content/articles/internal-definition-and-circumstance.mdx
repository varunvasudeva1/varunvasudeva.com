Is a person good or bad? Can a person inherently be a good, or a bad, person? This
paper - this thought - was an attempt at answering the question. The basic premises of the
thought are two things: internal definition and circumstance.
First, to define the concept of internal definition. Internal definition is the moral
definition of “good” and “bad” in a person's mind. This shows not only their judgement but
their thought process with respect to the world of morality. As most things in the world of
philosophy are, this is a large hidden variable we can only infer things from but never truly
see. Internal definition grows and matures within the subject and is a result of their
upbringing, interactions, thoughts, beliefs, and, funnily enough, circumstance. Thus, it is
possible to say internal definition is a subset of a larger set that is circumstance. However,
solely at this point (let it be noted), this wouldn't be entirely accurate because the
circumstance this paper discusses is not an internal circumstance that produces a particular
internal definition; it is circumstance that determines a particular mindset that influences
internal definition to come into play in the first place.
<br />
Now, to define circumstance. In the case of this paper, circumstance should be defined
as an event, or a series of events, that affect or alter the mental state of the
subject in question. More often than not, it is human nature to be affected by events
in life - be it positive or negative. I would not usually be so quick to resort to
examples but human behaviour is best described with modern human life. Taking a one-line
example of a high- school going child who fails a test, gets in trouble with the
principal, and loses a football game all in the same day. The demeanour of that child
in the foreseeable, albeit temporary, future will be negatively charged and perhaps
unpleasant.
<br />
Moving onto a fictitious case study, we can explore the moral dilemma humans can
encounter whilst trying to categorise other humans as either good or bad. Imagine
the following scenario and empathise — a man is the victim of a hate crime and his
family is the target. He is the sole survivor and this is his punishment. This man
seeks vengeance as his redemption. Living alone with the memories of his family's
voices still in their house and the laughs of his enemies ringing in his ears. What
is justified? Is there sufficient justice at all? Would this man be considered bad
because he wishes to commit a crime to avenge another crime? Or would he be understood
because his loved ones were snatched from him and he would be gifted the right to
avenge them? Could he, perhaps, be considered noble in the eyes of people who believe
that “justice does not descend from its pinnacle”? This debate lies in the eye of
the observer - the unofficial judge of character and circumstance. Here is where
internal definition lies. According to the observer viewing this situation, the matter
rests on the ledge of their internal definition. What lies within their sphere of
good until it spills over the edge into evil.
<br />
Simply where internal definition lies, circumstance lies too. If the observer has
been in a position even remotely relatable to the subject in question, he/she will
empathise to the situation and understand it, leaning more closely towards good or
neutral as compared to bad. On the contrary, if the circumstance of the subject is
lost on the observer, they are more likely to see the crime in the plainest sense
anyone could: a crime. Thus, they would lean towards deeming it bad. Put concisely,
internal definition and circumstance plague both the subject and the observer with
respect to a moral dilemma. In the case of the subject, circumstance is first in
the order of causality in order for internal definition to exist or be triggered.
This internal definition causes the self to determine whether what they are doing
would be categorised as good or bad. In the case of the observer, the subject's circumstance
must, again, occur first. If circumstances do not occur, the position to use internal
definition is voided entirely. Hence, in this case, it is fair to say the use of
internal definition is dependent on the occurrence of events, or circumstance.
<br />
In my personal opinion, I believe the definition of good and bad to be fluid based
on the above two-pronged theory. No person comes hardwired with a static personality
that is immune to change due to circumstance or thought processes. Thus, it is up
to internal definition and circumstance in a human's life that distinguishes between
an impractical universal model of good and bad.
