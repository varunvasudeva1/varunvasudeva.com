Inevitability is defined as the quality of being certain to happen. In quantum
mechanical terms, nothing is ever a certainty and neither is it an impossibility. However,
inevitability in day-to-day life usually stands as the certain outcome in any given scenario. In
human life, death, ageing, and illnesses are inevitable. This inevitability tends to catch up with
human beings wherever they may go or whatever they may achieve - except, perhaps, the
elixir of immortality.
<br />
There are deep ties between the physics and the metaphysics of the conundrum of inevitability.
The physics explains one side and the metaphysics explains the other - this theory
is the resolution of the logic loop that lies somewhere along the line bridging the
gap between the two, with regard to this matter. To introduce the physics, we must
first talk about the spacetime continuum. In the fabric of spacetime, the four-dimensional
continuum the Universe exists in, events and the time in between them coexist. Say
there are three events A, B, and C with distinct time intervals separating them.
Also say that there are two observers in this portion of spacetime that are observing
events A, B, & C take place. There is a large possibility, depending on the observer's
frame of reference, that the two observers will disagree on the sequence of events
and even the time that separates them. For example, Observer 1 could observe a sequence
CAB whereas Observer 2 could observe the sequence BAC. Terming the events in a chronological
order, event C is Observer 1's past, A is the present, and B is the future. However,
for Observer 2, B is the past, A is the present, and C is the future. This itself
raises a major dilemma because one observer's past becomes another observer's future.
The event itself, in this case, cannot be changed from occurring at all. All events
being clearly defined at some point or the other severely questions the regular uncertainty
of human life. Where does this leave our sense of free will? Where goes the notion
that we are “masters of our own fate” if we can't stop certain events from taking
place?
<br />
Using this frame of reference, we see that free will does not really exist. From
birth to death, an individual lives his/her life as the pawn in a game of chess that's
already been played before. No room for true innovation, no room for true choice,
no room for change. In case of catastrophic events in this individual's life, the
choice is not really theirs to make every time that version of reality plays out.
If this is true, many theories that explain the ramifications of choice on an individual's
life simply collapse. Here is where the deep ties between the physics and metaphysics
of this question become truly evident. Talking about the multiverse theory, coined
by Princeton scientist Hugh Everett, becomes inconsequential because there is only
one outcome in a universe sans free will: the outcome that the individual has coded
into their lives. The multiple universes Everett proposes fall apart and one of the
largest and most widely accepted interpretations of quantum mechanics is discredited.
Inevitability becomes a 100% certainty, a technical scientific impossibility (oxymoronically
so), and free will is dead.
<br />
The reconciliation of a world with both inevitability and free will lies in the events.
The proposal in this case is that the events in an individual's life in question
remain inevitable. If a person is to be diagnosed with cancer, the cancer itself
as an event remains inevitable. However, the reaction, along with emotional, mental,
and physical health, of the individual is the deciding factor between one outcome
or the other. Put simply, our actions, born out of free will, change the interpretation
of the inevitable event. An individual diagnosed with cancer could go about the news
in a plethora of different ways. In this case, we take two examples: one where the
individual attempts to live a healthier life, get treated, and try to maximise efforts
in recovery and one where the individual gives up on life, picks up drug- abuse as
a coping mechanism, and eventually overdoses. Say the difference between those choices
is 30 more years of life in the first scenario. Therein lies the theoretical caveat
to a universe that functions on both inevitability and free will of sentient beings
such as humans: the reaction to an event also plays a role in deciding the outcome
of an event, rather than just the event alone.
<br />
However, a darker question looms over the premise of the reconciliatory theory: what
stops the reaction governing the outcome of the event from being predetermined: part
of the code in the individual's life? To answer this, I can use the help of nothing
but other prevalent theories as data to support my theory doesn't exist yet - and
may never. Again, in this case, if a reaction of an individual to an event is predetermined,
it can only be predetermined to yield one reaction. If the event has a plethora of
possible predetermined reactions to choose from and chooses one at random, the phenomena
is exempt from being bound by a theory in the first place. It would be the equivalent
of placing a number into a mathematical function that yields different values of
data every time the function runs. This would be a theory only possibly created using
the help of existing data sets: however, these data sets cannot exist without data
sets available for other quantum mechanics interpretations, proving or disproving
the above statements with reference to the truth behind the multiverse theory. Even
when conceding to the premise that the reaction is predetermined as a prerequisite
for the existence of human beings in the spacetime continuum, we fail to factor in
theories that may disrupt the consistent functioning of the sequence of causality.
<br />
Chaos Theory, or the Butterfly Effect, explains the effect that small anomalies have
on any given situation. The most common example of this theory is the possibility
that when a butterfly flaps its wings at some point on Earth, the wind generated
is a possible trigger for a tornado in another part of the world. Accounting for
this kind of an anomaly is virtually impossible and, thus, changes the outcome by
a little, to say the least. Even in this scenario, the premise of there being just
one outcome to a sequence of events collapses as a second version then exists. Thus,
breaking out of the logic loop that exists on the bridge between the physics and
metaphysics of the question of free will in the universe, this theory points the
existence of free will in a universe whose events can be called inevitable and provides
a point of reconciliation where both coexist within the laws of physics.
