Ovid in his book, Metamorphoses, demonstrates his skills as an experimentalist writer.
His themes center on differing ways of viewing topics such as creation, the character of the gods,
and love. He writes an anthology of transformation stories that give meaning and origin to the
things of this world and of the supernatural world. Of particular importance, and seen throughout
his stories, is the theme of love and lust. Ovid tells of all types of loves: from unrequited
passions, to familial love, motherly and sisterly love, to true love. However, most examined and
critiqued in his works is the concept of lust and desire as a form of love. This is a scene
paralleled in his stories time and time again from gods and humans alike. It is a force that affects
us all. Such a force that, in his viewpoint, brings about violence and destruction. Ovid paints
pictures for the reader in which a predator attacks his prey, emphasizing the experience of the
victim, in order to show the violence of excessive lust. This is especially demonstrated in the
parallel stories of “Apollo and Daphne” and “Tereus, Procne, and Philomela” as the desire of
both Apollo and Tereus ultimately lead to the entrapment and destruction of Daphne and
Philomela.
<br />

“Apollo and Daphne” found in Book I: The Shapes of Changes follows the story of the
god Apollo as he pursues a nymph named Daphne in his desire for her. Apollo had recently
defeated a Python and was outspoken in his victory to the god Cupid. In return, Cupid fires two
of his arrows, one of love and the other of lead, into Apollo and Daphne respectively. Apollo
immediately falls in love with Daphne and she, conversely, is undesiring. A chase ensues as
Daphne flees and Apollo fights to reach her. Eventually, Apollo catches up to her, but just as he
is about to grab her, Daphne is transformed into a laurel tree by her father, Peneus. From then on,
Apollo declares his love for the laurel tree and makes it his own.
Paralleling this story, and found later in Ovid's Metamorphoses in Book VI: Of Praise
and Punishment, is the story of “Tereus, Procne, and Philomela” which tells of the destruction of
a family unit. Tereus is married to Procne but is overcome with desire for Procne's sister,
Philomela. So he tricks Philomela and brings her to a remote area where he rapes her.
Afterwards, to keep her from telling of what happened, he cuts out her tongue and continues to
defile her. Philomela is left on the island for a year until she is rescued by her sister. Procne then
enacts revenge on Tereus by killing their son and feeding it to Tereus. When Tereus finds out, he
pursues them in rage and they transform into birds.
One of Ovid's main tools in portraying this theme of desire and lust as a destructive force
is through his use of imagery in nature. For example, in the story “Apollo and Daphne”, Ovid
uses an extended simile to describe the destructive nature of Apollo's passion for Daphne.
<br />

> _“Now just as in a field of the harvest stubble is all burned off, or as hedges are set ablaze
> when, if by chance, some careless traveler should brush one with his torch or toss away
> the still-smoldering brand at break of day-just so the smitten god went up in flames until
> his heart was utterly afire, and hope sustained his unrequited passion”_ **Ovid,
> Metamorphosis, Book I, p.35, 678-685**.
> <br />
Here, descriptive terms centered around ruin are used to paint a picture of a field being set on
fire. This field is completely “burned off” and the hedges are “set ablaze” resembling the heart of
the “smitten god” that was “utterly afire” giving the sense of a complete lack of control for the
destruction that ensues as a result of the power lust holds. The traveler is described as careless in
comparison to someone who falls susceptible to the force that is “unrequited passion”. As a
whole, Ovid's use of imagery here emphasizes how dangerous and reckless desire is. It destroys
everything in its path, leaving remnants of what once was, behind. Just as the field and hedges
are burned down and changed, so too changed is the person lust has afflicted. The false sense of
hope given by the possibility of achieving his passion, and the possibility of what will happen
when Apollo reaches Daphne, only fuels the fire of desire he holds for her more. But ultimately,
this fire is ruinous, demonstrating Ovid's viewpoint of lust equating to destruction.
Ovid also uses predator-prey comparisons throughout his writing in order to draw
emphasis to the destructive nature of lust through the experience of the victim. 
<br />

In the story “Apollo and Daphne” when Apollo begins his pursuit of Daphne, Ovid writes,
<br />

> _“Admonished by his own passion, he accelerates, and runs as swiftly as a Gallic hound
> chasing a rabbit through an open field; the one seeks shelter and the other, prey — he
> clings to her”_ **Book I, p.37, 735-739**.
> <br />
Apollo is seen in likeness to a Gallic hound, the predator, as he chases a rabbit, personified as
Daphne, through a field. He is driven to chase her by his passion for her, it is the catalyst for him
to “accelerate” and draw near to her; a primal instinct to reach his prey and “cling to her”. In
contrast, Daphne is portrayed as a rabbit fleeing from its predator, “seeking shelter” to save her
from ensuing danger. The resulting scene painted for readers is the desperation of Daphne to find
safety from the imminent danger closing in on her. This danger is rooted in Apollo's lust; he is
controlled by his passion for Daphne, bringing out this predator instinct to get what he wants; to
run after her, trap her, and make her his own. Daphne's safety and security are destroyed as she
flees from Apollo and fights to avoid his lustful passions.
<br />

In another example, from the story “Apollo and Daphne”, Apollo is trying to convince
Daphne that he isn't chasing her out of ill will. He proclaims his love for her in an attempt to get
her to slow down and Ovid, again, uses predator-prey rhetoric to demonstrate the vulnerability of
Daphne as she seeks to flee her pursuer.
<br />

> _"Thus lamb flees wolf, thus dove from eagle flies on trembling wings, thus deer from
> lioness, thus any creature flees its enemy, but I am stalking you because of love”_ **Book I,
> p.35-36, 698-701**.
> <br />
Demonstrated above, Daphne is directly compared to a lamb fleeing, a dove flying on “trembling
wings” and a deer. All these creatures are animals that are seen as weak and are commonly
stalked and preyed upon in nature. They are left in a state of vulnerability as they “flee their
enemy” and their helplessness is evident, especially when portrayed as trembling. The unequal
power dynamic existing between Apollo and Daphne is clear from this comparison as the
predator “stalks” his prey. Apollo, in likeness to the wolf, eagle, and lioness is the enemy. He is
the source of danger creating fear in Daphne as she flees for her life. But Apollo, overcome in
what he feels is love for Daphne, is desperate to reach her and expresses his desire for her. But
she continues to run, fearful of the danger contained in his passion.
Ovid mirrors usage of predator-prey rhetoric to highlight the experience of the victim
from the destruction lust creates later in Metamorphoses in the story of “Tereus, Procne, and
Philomela” as Tereus asserts his dominance over Philomela.
<br />

> _“And scarcely able to defer his lust, the barbarian exults, and keeps his eyes fixed firmly
> on his now defenseless prize, exactly as when Jove's great bird of prey, the eagle, drops
> into his lofty nest the hare gripped in his talons, and the prey and captor both know there
> is no escape”_ **Book VI, p.211, 739-745**.
> <br />
In this text, Tereus is directly related to a barbarian, an uncivilized &amp; primitive creature known
for violence. This barbarian instinct is expressed in his uncontrollable lust he has for Philomela
as he is “scarcely able to defer it”. Also comparable to an eagle, the bird of the most powerful
god, Jove, Tereus is expressed in great power as he takes Philomela. The eagle, a “great bird of
prey” returns to his nest with the “hare gripped in his talons” knowing he has succeeded in
trapping his prize. Likewise, Tereus has taken Philomela away from her father to a deserted
island where all protection is lost. She is his “defenseless prize” and the hare trapped by the
eagle. Philomela is completely exposed and vulnerable now in the presence of Tereus. He “fixes
his eyes on her” with the knowledge that he has almost succeeded in getting that which he
desired most. This is expressed in the text as being known by both the prey and the captor; there
was no hope for escape and Philomela was completely at the mercy of Tereus. In this position,
lust motivated the attack on Philomela and she was left in the path of emerging destruction.
Predator-prey rhetoric is seen again in the story of “Tereus, Procne, and Philomela” after
Tereus has attacked Philomela to give readers a picture to the horror of the event.
<br />

> _“And after he was done with her she shuddered like a young lamb, broken by an old grey
> wolf and flung aside, who cannot yet believe that she is safe; or like a wounded dove, her
> plumage brightly stained with her own blood, who trembles with her dread that the sharp
> claws which have embraced and raked her will return”_ **Book VI, p.211-212, 756-762**.
> <br />
Philomela is directly described as a shuddering young lamb who has been broken. She is viewed
as a wounded dove stained with her own blood, trembling with dread, fearful of the return of
danger. These stark images embody the helplessness and brokenness Philomela is experiencing
as the gentlest of creatures are used to parallel her character. These animals are ones that are pure
white symbolizing purity and innocence, set in opposition to powerful entities such as a wolf and
the claws of an undisclosed predator. The agony and pain she feels is overwhelming as she
shudders in brokenness, trembles in fear, and is forever afflicted with the event, stained by her
own blood. Tereus, personified as the grey wolf and owner of raking claws, has given into his
lustful passion and violently attacked Philomela, flinging her aside when he was finished, but not
without the prospect of coming back to cause more destruction. He allowed his desire for
Philomela to take control, causing him to commit the ultimate form of violence, compromising
Philomela and bringing her endless suffering.
<br />

When considering the two stories, “Apollo and Daphne” and “Tereus, Procne, and
Philomela”, it is evident Ovid utilizes heavy predator-prey rhetoric to demonstrate the
powerlessness of the victim and the entrapment they experience. The comparisons drawn
between those propelled by lust and the primal instincts they have to act on such desires,
regardless of the cost, explain the power that lust holds in the creation of violence. “Tereus,
Procne, and Philomela” is a response and further continuation of the story “Apollo and Daphne”
as it builds upon the destructive nature of lust. Daphne was ultimately transformed into a laurel
tree and forever became a part of Apollo as he made her his own. He trapped her forever. But, in
contrast, Philomela was physically harmed by Tereus; she was defiled and mutilated, a clear
picture of violence. While undertones of such destruction were seen in “Apollo and Daphne”
through predator-prey comparisons, “Tereus, Procne, and Philomela” clearly portrayed the
destruction caused by lust through both intensified predator-prey rhetoric and physical actions.
As a whole, the experiences of both Daphne and Philomela are emphasized as they are overtaken
by those who desire them most resulting in their own powerlessness and destruction.
