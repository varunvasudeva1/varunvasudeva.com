Our next stage of evolution is, perhaps, one of the most sought-after scientific
advancements amongst finding alien life and the cure for cancer. The evolution of
Homo Sapiens from the original single-celled amoeba is a marvel of a process
almost unfathomable to evolutionary biologists because of the sheer magnitude of
branching out of cellular systems. There are incredible ancillary benefits to the
evolution of any system, just as there would be in the evolution of the Homo Sapiens
to the next stage on their evolutionary chart. However, the progressing evolution for
Homo Sapiens may not prove to be as organic as the previous ones have been. The
higher-thinking abilities available to the human race have led to scientific discoveries
that themselves may be the steppingstones to an artificially induced evolutionary
stage. This paper will not only discuss the benefits of such an evolution and their
advantages to the species, but it will also discuss the ramifications these benefits on
the planet and its resources.
<br />

First, to address the necessity of evolution. Darwin's evolutionary theory of natural
selection, albeit actually describing reproductive fitness and not general fitness,
provides a sound template to address the need to evolve into the next stage of humanity's
evolution. Due to mankind's unsustainable models of development, the Earth is now
regressing into an unstable environmental state, which may lead to even more catastrophic
climates and disasters. Until this situation can be reversed or weathered-out, humans
need a biological safeguard against the sheer might of nature — that safeguard would
be a greater ability to protect ourselves in case of heinous disasters that lead
to thousands of deaths across the globe. In addition to this, the Earth is also being
depleted of its natural resources at a faster rate every day, giving rise to the
fact that it cannot harbor growing human life for long. These needs give extreme
importance unto the resilience of human beings and methods of increasing it. An artificial
evolution would adapt the human race in such a way that we would be able to withstand
the harsh conditions on Earth that will eventually occur as a response to our massive
carbon footprint. Over millennia, evolution has been the answer to problems plaguing
species. When animals had to get away from larger predators, some of them, now known
as birds, evolved the ability to fly. No consensus exists on whether birds evolved
when animals started gliding from trees or jumping from the ground, but there is
a consensus on the fact that the ability birds now possess to evade land-based predators
has solved the problem of their threatened lifestyles. Humanity could attempt to
eliminate some of its problems, as stated earlier, by inducing its next evolutionary
stage artificially. The transhumanist (H<sup>+</sup>) movement is a movement dedicated
to the preservation of the human race by advancing characteristics such as strength,
agility, lifespan, resistance to diseases, and more. It is the belief that the human
race can evolve beyond its current physical and mental limitations. It is one of
the less radical approaches towards evolving humans to their next intermediary, or
maybe permanent, state of existence. The scientific basis of transhumanism is gene-splicing
and editing in order to bring about a desired benefit that did not exist or remained
dormant previously. A reduced analogy of this would be to equate transhumanism to
“bio-hacking” — and while they are similar, transhumanism deals with high-level scientific
processes such as gene-sequencing, whereas biohacking could be something as simple
as consuming more protein to aid in the growth of muscles. Transhumanism, however,
is a concept still to be implemented on a large and successful scale.
<br />

There are immediately apparent benefits to such a transformation to humans. For one,
humans that are alive and well today would be able to cash in on the advantageous
points of the transhumanist movement. Depending on what the focus of a person's particular
enhancement is, different aspects of the human body could be strengthened massively.
By affecting the protein structure of muscles, human strength could overthrow its
current limitations and members of the human race would be able to avoid the multitude
of disasters they experience on a daily basis. By living for longer periods of time,
individuals would be able to lead more productive lives with the ageing process further
spread out over a longer amount of time: prime performance would last for multiple
decades instead of just one, causing a massive surge in productivity across the globe.
The lethal effects of a lot of chemicals could be completely counteracted, so as
to reduce deaths caused due to accidental ingestion of these chemicals.
<br />

While this world sounds like a utopia, one cannot ignore the foreseeable impacts
of a super-race on an already-dying planet with finite resources. An evolved human
would consume far more resources as compared to both Homo Sapiens and archaic Homo
Sapiens or Neanderthals, simply to sustain the power granted by the next stage of
advancement as a species. This can be said simply by observing the exponential jump
in resource consumption since the previous stage of human evolution to our current
one. This increased usage of resources would not be because of a physical need to
consume — just as the evolution from Neanderthals to Homo Sapiens saw the rise of
agricultural and industrial revolution, the next stage of evolution would lead to
greater advancements that would require more resources. The aforementioned surge
in productivity caused by longer lifespans would cause an even larger hit in the
number of resources consumed on both a private and commercial scale. Human population
would swell to unimaginable numbers due to the delayed natural culling, that is death,
due to increased lifespans and resistance to viruses and bacteria. Assuming that
this evolutionary device was rolled out slowly to people worldwide, crime rates might
increase if those who are evolved seek to hurt those that aren't. It is true that
the intervention required by police and other governmental resources would decrease
due to enhanced abilities but these increased crime rates due to personal attacks
would far outnumber the decrease and cause a larger consumption of resources overall.
<br />

Taking a look at the matter statistically, it is a fact that Earth bears resources
just enough for four, maybe five, billion people. Those are resources enough for
the sustenance and lavish lifestyle of the four billion people that inhabit a planet
that is similarly sized to Earth and, presumably, has the same type of resources.
Life and population growth on Earth as it is currently is not sustainable in the
first place. This births a conundrum: transhumanism-based evolution is both a need
and an impossibility. A race of next-generation human beings that would consume more
resources is definitely nothing our Earth could currently support. Transhumanism
making strides of progress towards their goal of an enhanced humanity would usually
be worth backing in its entirety because of its fairly low-risk high-reward returns,
provided standardized clinical trials are implemented. However, with an unsustainable
model of resource consumption, it doesn't bode well for the future of our planet.
Even in the case of exoplanets with additional resources of their own that humans
could actually migrate to, it still isn't economically feasible to transport the
four billion excess people Earth will soon have. This is perhaps the largest logistical
problem to plague the adoption of transhumanism to better the capacity of the human
race.
<br />

There is also the topic of the psychological effects of evolving almost immediately.
This is one of the affordances of an artificially induced evolution: it has the ability
to affect the human race at an unbelievably quicker pace than previous instances
of evolution have been able to. The psychological effects of such an event on an
entire planet's population is difficult to discern effectively. However, it is safe
to assume that with billions of people acquiring abilities they did not have before,
however minute, can cause disruptions to break out everywhere. For example, in the
case of a man evolving to a stage with increased strength, he might be inclined to
test these abilities out in the open. It is a matter of the inherent good and bad
qualities of the man himself what he will choose to do — something mundane, virtuous,
or evil. The statistical possibility of all events spread out across the entire world's
population is equally likely, so a quantization of disturbance among social spheres
is unlikely to be found unless data someday exists. An evolution like this would
not just affect people psychologically, it would affect their reality. Things that
were previously inaccessible to humans without the aid of machines could possibly
be brought within reach. To state an example, we can imagine an instance where the
world was to evolve to become more physically capable. As a result, they became faster.
This would not only bring about psychological change, but it would change what people
are able to do. Previous world records for athletic events would be smashed, the
need for vehicles to travel short distances would decrease drastically as people
would be able to traverse greater distances in shorter amounts of time, and other
events of the same kind might take place. Due to this evolution, the environment
we have constructed for ourselves — stock markets, businesses, governments, legislature
— all of it would be subject to change in order to keep pace with the changes brought
about by evolution. The impacts of an artificially induced evolution, primarily by
virtue of its incredibly rapid implementation, are spread out on a spectrum ranging
from a logistical nightmare to the creation of an elite race without time being lost
in the process.
<br />

The transhumanist movement would be a game-changer for many industries and a revelation
in terms of productivity and industrialism. However, it simply doesn't work due to
the finite set of rapidly decreasing resources that we have currently on Earth. The
necessary conditions for transhumanism to establish itself as the next stage of human
evolution, Earth would need an immediate injection of resources from another planet
and a safe and efficient method of gene-splicing that would carry out the effects
of the evolutionary biological code. It would take a long time for an evolution of
this kind to spread across the globe in the case of individual administration of
a serum that changes genetic composition or structure, but a much shorter time in
case of an airborne/waterborne/communicable bacteria/virus that affects human genetics
in the same way a serum would. Although the time taken for each method to present
a hundred-percent transmission rate varies greatly, it is insignificant as compared
to the amount of time natural evolution would take, if another stage is even likely
to occur. To summarize, it would be necessary for an efficient and safe delivery
method of an evolution-inducing material to human beings along with the existence
of ample resources to adequately sustain a race of beings that is more dependent
on resources than it previously was. We currently don't have a goal for human evolution
– what would we want to mitigate against in Earth's upcoming reset? In today's rapidly
deteriorating environment, there is no dearth of natural disasters the Earth won't
harbor. Before we even begun the next evolution, we would need to be able to identify
humanity's greatest natural threats in the coming century. Second, we don't have
a delivery method – this is perhaps the least worrying part if we wanted to implement
the transhumanist ideals. The state of gene therapy and molecular biology in the
modern world has led to breakthroughs in health science that we once couldn't have
imagined. Lastly, we don't have the resources. It is a mathematical impossibility
for a planet built to house four billion people to house seven, or more, billion.
This becomes even more true in the case of a super race. While an artificial evolution
may be a theoretical Hail Mary, it simply isn't feasible enough currently to even
warrant an effort.
