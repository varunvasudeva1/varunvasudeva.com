# Varun Vasudeva Portfolio Website

[varunvasudeva.com](https://varunvasudeva.com) is my personal portfolio website - a collection of my projects, music, articles, and links.

## Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Primary framework
- [React](https://react.dev) - Frontend framework for reactive components
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework for styling
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) - Hosting

I'm a big fan of this stack because it allows me to build a fast, modern, and maintainable website with minimal effort. Astro has an amazing developer experience and comes with a bunch of templates that can be bootstrapped into a new project easily.

Additionally, it's important to consider what solution is best for what kind of problem. I love using Next.js for larger applications but, considering that portfolios are mostly static, Astro is the more performant and simple choice.

Vercel is a good platform for hosting any application and I use it a lot too but find that Cloudflare's built-in DDOS protection and CDN are a better fit for static sites.
